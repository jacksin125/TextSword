PROJECT TITLE: Text Sword

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The goal of the game is to level up, unlock all the buildings, and get the best equipment. 
The player begins in a town with different buildings in it. The game will give the player a series of numbered 
options, and the player will have to choose between them, and that will determine where they go and what happens 
next in the game. If the player enters a number that is not an option or the wrong data type, the game will 
reply with a snarky response. As the game progresses, the player will be able to go outside the town to fight 
enemies, and unlock access to the different buildings in town.In order to make money and gain experience, you 
must fight enemies outside of town.
